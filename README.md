## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a browser-side tic tac toe game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I created this project as part of my journey to learning full-stack web development. This project summarises a lot of topics I've learnt in HTML and CSS, while introducing a couple of project-specific JavaScript functionality, such as implementing the game logic and handling form submissions.

On this website, users are able to play tic tac toe with another person on the same browser. Players can include their names and the winner will have their name displayed on a banner.
